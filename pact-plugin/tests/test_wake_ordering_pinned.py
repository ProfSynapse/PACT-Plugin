Structural pin tests for the wake/idle message-ordering hardening rules.

Pins the reader-facing instruction surfaces that teach both sides of the
wake/idle delivery-ordering race:

  teammate-side (skills/pact-agent-teams/SKILL.md):
    - "On Wake: Disk-First Re-Read (Seam-Agnostic)" — durable state is
      authoritative on every wake; message content is advisory.
    - "Counter-Confirm Suppression" — fresh disk read before any
      state-clarification message; suppress when already resolved.
    - "Boundary-Drain Rule" — inbox drain + drain report before every
      protocol-boundary message.
  lead-side (protocols/pact-completion-authority.md + its byte-mirrored
  region in protocols/pact-protocols.md, and agents/pact-orchestrator.md):
    - "Crossed-Wake Idles: Discriminate by Timestamp Direction" — including
      the behavioral non-goal note that synchronous wake/send detection is
      dead-by-construction, and the pre-directive idle-straggler
      discrimination (a tick predating the directive send is a straggler,
      never a stall signal).
    - "Directive-Reflection Check" — mid-turn directives verified against
      boundary-message deliverables before acting.
  stall-detection (protocols/pact-agent-stall.md + its byte-mirrored
  region in pact-protocols.md):
    - post-wake / live-intentional_wait idles are delivery-ordering
      artifacts, not stalls, and the exemption is bidirectional: an idle
      crossing a just-sent directive in either order is not stall
      evidence (a predating tick is a straggler).
  persona (agents/pact-orchestrator.md):
    - the §12 crossed-wake summary incl. the predating-straggler outcome
      ("take no action at all").

PRESENCE pins, not counts. Unlike the Read-Trigger marker phrase (see
test_read_trigger_precondition_pinned.py EXPECTED_COUNTS), none of these
phrases is intended to recur a fixed number of times per surface, so count
pins would add lockstep-maintenance cost without catching a real erosion
shape. No new EXPECTED_COUNTS-style lockstep is introduced by this module.

PHRASES, not line shapes. Several pinned sentences are hard-wrapped in the
shipped markdown and several rule sentences share a line with pre-existing
list-item text (semantically identical markdown renderings), and tool
language inside a pinned span is inline-code formatted. Phrase pins
therefore match against backtick-AND-whitespace-NORMALIZED text (see
_phrase: strip backticks, then `" ".join(text.split())`) so they survive
re-wrapping and inline-code rendering alike — a retired rendering whose
backtick sits inside the phrase span ("`SendMessage` FIRST") is caught,
not masked. Heading pins match line-anchored raw lines
(per the section-presence convention in test_read_trigger_precondition_
pinned.py — substring matching for headings is a phantom-green shape: an
H4 line contains its H3 prefix as a substring).

Mirror discipline: pact-protocols.md is pinned as its own surface for every
phrase that lives in a byte-mirrored region (Completion Authority, Agent
Stall Detection). verify-protocol-extracts.sh enforces byte-parity upstream;
the duplicate pins here match the actual reader-facing surface set rather
than relying solely on the upstream script (same rationale as DOC_SURFACES
in test_read_trigger_precondition_pinned.py).

Counter-test-by-revert (verified at authoring time): with the five doc
surfaces reverted to their pre-hardening state (git checkout <pre-fix-ref>
-- <5 doc paths>), every test in this module fails EXCEPT the absence pins
(which also pass pre-fix only where the retired token was already absent;
the orchestrator absence pin goes RED pre-fix because the retired
Monitor-signal token was present there). Restore with git checkout HEAD --
<paths>. The exact flip-set cardinality observed at authoring time is
recorded in the module-level comment at the bottom of this file.

# Counter-test flip-set record (measured at authoring time; see module
# docstring). With the five surfaces reverted to their pre-hardening state
# and this module run against them: {53 failed, 8 passed}. Heading pins
# 8/8 RED, phrase pins 33/33 RED (no pinned phrase pre-existed on any
# surface), cross-ref pins 11/11 RED, absence pin RED on
# pact-orchestrator.md (retired token present pre-fix) and GREEN on the
# other four surfaces (token never present there). The 8 GREEN =
# anchor-integrity 4/4 (pure functions of module constants — intentionally
# revert-immune) + the 4 vacuously-satisfied absence pins.
# Section-body deletion probes (measured after the body-pin additions):
# gutting the Counter-Confirm Suppression body while keeping its heading
# fails exactly its 2 body pins; deleting the On Wake residual-race step
# fails exactly the rule-home span pin while the shorter single-empty-read
# pin stays green via the On-Rejection parenthetical.
# Matcher-robustness probes (measured): rewriting a referrer's slug to a
# longer slug that prefix-engulfs the pinned one flips the slug pin RED
# (terminator guard); deleting a section heading while leaving a fenced
# code example of the same heading line flips the heading pin RED
# (fence exclusion). Neither hardening changes the flip-set above.
#
# 2026-08-27 addendum (pre-directive idle-straggler cycle): the phrase-pin
# inventory above grew 33 (authoring) -> 39 (#1525 rule pins: straggler
# classification, bidirectional opener, anti-acceleration x both mirrored
# surfaces) -> 50 (remediation cycle 1: ambiguity durable-read + claim-absent
# fallthrough + two-idle gate + straggler-exclusion x both mirrored surfaces,
# stall-exemption bidirectional clause x stall + SSOT, persona straggler
# outcome). Module cases 61 -> 67 -> 78. Counter-test for the #1525 pins
# (measured 2026-08-27): identical both-surface reword of the straggler
# phrase — extract/SSOT byte-parity preserved, so the audit gate stays
# green and this module is the sole red source — flips exactly the 2
# per-surface pins for that phrase (predicted pre-run; observed exactly
# 2 failed). All 17 post-authoring phrase pins go RED under a pre-#1525
# revert: none of their phrases pre-existed on any surface
# (occurrence-verified at pin time).
#
# 2026-08-27 addendum (#1530 send-vocabulary unification cycle): the
# retired "wake-send" term was unified to "directive send" across the
# three surfaces that carried it (completion-authority extract, its SSOT
# region, orchestrator persona §5/§12); the teammate SKILL and stall
# protocol never carried it. Phrase pins 50 -> 53 (unified postdating
# send-term x 3 surfaces) and a new retired-term absence test x 3 swept
# surfaces; module cases 78 -> 84. PHANTOM-GREEN CAUGHT BY MEASUREMENT:
# the short pin "postdates your directive send" is satisfied pre-revert
# on both mirrored surfaces by the #1529 bidirectional opener's own
# sentence ("When the notification postdates your directive send"), so
# the mirrored-surface pins anchor to the longer postdating-item span
# ("On an idle notification that postdates your directive send"), which
# exists only at the reworded item. Counter-test (measured 2026-08-27,
# docs reverted to pre-unification in an isolated copy): exactly 6 failed
# = the 3 unified-term presence pins + the 3 retired-term absence cases;
# 78 passed; post-unification 84/84 green.
#
# 2026-08-28 addendum (acceptance-pair flip cycle): the lead-side
# acceptance/rejection two-call atomic pair was flipped from
# SendMessage-first to TaskUpdate-first across 9 files (persona, 5
# commands, completion-authority extract, ct-teachback extract, SSOT
# mirrors). New arm: 3 "TaskUpdate FIRST" presence cases (normative
# surfaces) + 8 retired-ordering absence cases (3 normative + 5
# commands); module cases 84 -> 95. Counter-test (measured 2026-08-28,
# 9 doc files stash-reverted to pre-flip): exactly 6 failed = the 3
# presence cases + the absence cases on the 3 normative surfaces (the
# retired tokens pre-existed there); the 5 command absence cases stayed
# GREEN pre-flip (the commands' retired form was
# "`SendMessage(to=X, ...)` FIRST" — not the contiguous token this pin
# locks out), so they guard reintroduction, not the flip itself.
# Post-flip 95/95 green.
#
# 2026-08-28 follow-up (TEST-phase, lead-ordered): the gap noted above —
# the command surfaces' own retired call-syntax rendering was unpinned —
# closed by test_retired_command_call_ordering_absent: 5 absence cases
# over COMMAND_SURFACES locking the fragment "FIRST, then `TaskUpdate"
# (the retired rendering's load-bearing sequence; the flipped form cannot
# produce it). Discriminator verified against BOTH forms before pinning:
# present in all 5 pre-flip files, absent from all 5 flipped files and
# every other instruction file. Module cases 95 -> 100. Counter-test
# (measured 2026-08-28): orchestrate.md alone reverted to pre-flip —
# exactly 1 failed = this test's orchestrate.md case (the 8 sibling
# ordering cases stayed green, as the original addendum predicted);
# post-restore 100/100 green.
#
# 2026-08-28 review-cycle extension (review-test fixer, lead-ordered): the
# same retired call-syntax rendering was unpinned on the ct-teachback
# extract and its byte-mirrored SSOT region — surfaces in NO arm of this
# module — and a LOCKSTEP revert of the pair leaves extract and region
# mutually byte-equal, so the protocol-extract audit passes too (measured
# during review: module + audit green with both reverted). The arm now
# parametrizes over COMMAND_FORM_SURFACES (5 commands + ct-teachback +
# SSOT): module cases 100 -> 102. Fragment discriminator verified in
# whitespace-normalized text (the retired rendering hard-wraps mid-fragment,
# so a raw line grep reads absent on both sides): present at base on both
# new surfaces, absent at flipped HEAD on both. Counter-test (measured
# 2026-08-28): ct-teachback.md alone reverted to pre-flip — exactly 1
# failed = this test's pact-ct-teachback.md case (101 passed); post-restore
# 102/102 green, audit module green alongside.
#
# 2026-08-28 cycle 2 (review-test, lead-ordered, user-directed EXCL-1
# adoption): _normalized now strips backticks via _phrase (applied to BOTH
# the file text and every pinned phrase), closing the rendering class where
# a backtick sits inside a phrase span — the retired "`SendMessage` FIRST"
# form was invisible to the contiguous absence token under a
# whitespace-only matcher. Full pin audit at HEAD under the new matcher:
# 79 pin x surface verdicts compared (53 phrase pins + 3 ordering-presence
# + 16 ordering-absence + 7 command-form) — ZERO verdict changes; module
# 102/102 green before and after. Counter-tests in a TEMP CLONE (no
# live-worktree mutation), all predictions exact: cell 1 — minimal
# backticked form "`SendMessage` FIRST" appended to orchestrate.md: OLD
# matcher 102 passed (blind), NEW matcher exactly 1 failed =
# ordering-absence[orchestrate.md]; cell 2 — full retired rendering
# wake-`SendMessage` FIRST, then `TaskUpdate(A, ...)`: NEW matcher exactly
# 2 failed (ordering-absence + command-form, both orchestrate.md), OLD
# matcher exactly 1 failed (command-form only — the measured pre-change
# blindness). Heading/slug/anchor/INBOX_GREW/wake-send pins match raw
# text or pure functions by design and are untouched.
