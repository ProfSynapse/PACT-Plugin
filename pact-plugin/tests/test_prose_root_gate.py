"""Regression gate: LLM-facing prose must not hardcode the Claude config root.

Agents follow prose literally, not the Python resolver, so a `~/.claude/...`
literal in an instruction surface makes a non-default-root install read, write,
and in one case execute against the WRONG install's state tree.

Three arms, two prose assertions, one allowlist, and a control per direction.
Implemented in pathlib rather than shell grep as a PORTABILITY requirement:
ARM 1's lookahead is PCRE and BSD `/usr/bin/grep` rejects `-P`. Where `grep -P`
appears to work, an interactive shell function may be rewriting `grep` to
`ugrep` — that function does not exist in CI.
