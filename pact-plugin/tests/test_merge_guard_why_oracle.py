Summary: Covers the merged-history loaders' failure diagnostic. Each cert module
         below loads a baked baseline with `git show` and records WHY a load
         failed into a module-level `_WHY` map; that text is the entire content
         of the skip reason its differential rows then emit. WHERE IT FIRES ON
         THE PRODUCTION PATH -- the module-level loads, not the arm below, which
         populates `_WHY` deliberately: a module populates it only in an
         environment missing one of the objects it loads. CI clones origin and
         misses every squash-merged feature-branch commit, so the modules baking
         one skip there; a developer's clone may still reach those through
         another remote, so which modules fire locally is a property of the
         CLONE, not of the module. Some modules bake only commits on main and so
         populate `_WHY` NOWHERE, and this oracle parametrizes over them anyway
         -- for those the arm is not observing a live diagnostic, it drives the
         failure directly, which is the only reason it can cover them at all.
         The current per-environment split is in the CI log's skip reasons,
         which the workflow's `-ra` surfaces; do not restate it here. A skip
         reason is read only when something has already gone wrong, which is
         exactly when a degraded one costs the most. Routing the loader's stderr
         (`stderr=subprocess.PIPE` back to `subprocess.DEVNULL`) leaves every
         reason a bare label with no cause, and without this arm nothing reddens.
         This module drives the failure directly instead of waiting for it.
