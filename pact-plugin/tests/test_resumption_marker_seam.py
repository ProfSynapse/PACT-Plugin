"""The resumption marker, written by the hook and read back the way the
secretary is told to read it — over the real journal, with nothing stubbed.

THE SEAM. `hooks/session_init.py` appends the marker; `agents/pact-secretary.md`
instructs the secretary to read it with the journal reader's `read-last` verb
against its own session directory. Both halves were covered, and each was
covered against a STUB of the other: `tests/test_session_init.py` patches
`session_init.append_event` and asserts the call, and
`tests/test_session_journal.py` exercises `read-last` on a hand-written journal
of synthetic types. Nothing joined them. A write that lands somewhere the
reader does not look, or under a shape the reader does not return, passes both
suites and fails in operation — and its failure is SILENT, because the reader
answering `null` is also the correct answer for a session that resumes nothing.

WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT STUB, deliberately: `append_event`, the journal file,
its path resolution, the ADDRESS resolution, and the reader. The write goes
through the hook's own call site into a real per-test session directory, and
the read is the reader's real CLI in a subprocess — the same verb, flag for
flag, that the agent body names. A future edit that reintroduces an
`append_event` patch here removes the only reason this file exists.

THE ADDRESS IS HALF THE SEAM, and an earlier form of this file only had the
other half. It resolved the read directory with `get_session_dir()` — the
LEAD-frame call the hook itself uses — and then congratulated the reader for
finding a marker at an address the real reader cannot compute: the secretary
runs off-lead, where that call returns ''. So the resolution below goes through
`pact_harvest.py resolve-session-dir`, which is what the agent body now names,
and the write directory is asserted equal to what that resolution returns. A
value the reader can parse at an address it cannot reach fails exactly as
silently as a value it cannot parse.

THE TYPE IS NOT NAMED HERE. It is extracted from the hook by
`test_resumption_marker_mirror.marker_event_type`, so this file asks "does what
the hook writes come back to the reader" rather than "does a literal I typed
come back". The literal's agreement with the agent body is that module's job;
this one is about the path between them.

WHAT REMAINS UNTESTABLE, so a green here is not over-read: that the secretary
ACTS on what it reads. What an agent's context holds, and what it does with it,
is not observable from a test. This file proves the fact is available to be
read, never that reading it changed anything.
