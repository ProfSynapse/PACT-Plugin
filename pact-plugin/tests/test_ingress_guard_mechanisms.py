Summary: Arms for the list-field guard at the memory-store ingresses. Three
arms, and THEY ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. Each one carries the property it
proves and the properties it cannot reach. Read the labels before you reshape
one of them.

  THE WITNESS is `TestARefusedCreateWritesNothingAtAll`. It measures the
  PROPERTY: a refused create leaves the store untouched. Its instrument is
  `conn.total_changes`, which counts each row written on the connection
  rather than rows in a table somebody remembered to name. A change count
  that does not move proves two things at one time: no partial write landed,
  AND no write ran before the guard. It is blind to no table, to no helper
  and to no statement order.

  THE TWO STATIC ARMS ARE COMPANIONS AND NOT SUBSTITUTES. Each one holds one
  property the witness cannot: IT FIRES ON A CODE EDIT EVEN WHEN NO TEST
  INPUT REACHES THE NEW PATH. A new ingress with no test of its own is
  invisible to a behavioural arm and visible to these.

WHY `total_changes` AND NOT A ROW COUNT. Measured on this platform: one plain
insert moves the count by 1, and one `vec0` insert moves it by 5, because the
virtual table writes shadow rows. So a count of two named tables misses the
shadow writes, and `total_changes` sees them without knowing their names.

    ITS PURPOSE IS FORWARD. A future third ingress that omits the guard goes

    WHAT THIS ARM CANNOT CATCH, and a reader who stops at the class name will
    get this wrong: IT ASSERTS CO-PRESENCE AND NOT POSITION. A guard moved
    after the write is still called in the enclosing function, so this arm
    STAYS GREEN on that mutant. `TestTheGuardPrecedesTheWrite` covers the
    position, and `TestARefusedCreateWritesNothingAtAll` covers the property
    that position is a proxy for.

    THE POPULATION IS EACH CALL OF THE MERGE HELPER, WHICH IS THE BROADER OF
    TWO READINGS THE DESIGN GIVES. The narrower reading covers the incoming
    side alone. NO MEASUREMENT ON THIS TREE SEPARATES THE TWO, because each
    present call sits in a function that calls the guard, so do not hunt for
    evidence that cannot be found.
    THE BROADER READING IS CHOSEN ON FAILURE DIRECTION. A narrower population
    lets a future incoming-side caller through when somebody mis-classifies
    it, and that miss is SILENT. The broader population can redden on a
    read-only caller instead, and that failure is LOUD and reaches a person.

    THE READ-SIDE CARVE-OUT, recorded because the design decided it and this
    arm does not encode it. The merge helper takes two parameters with
    different trust. The `existing` value comes from the database, and the
    design deliberately does NOT raise on the read side, because a raise
    there bricks updates to rows written by earlier code.
    SO, IF A FUTURE READ-ONLY CALLER REDDENS THIS ARM, THAT IS A DECISION

class TestTheGuardPrecedesTheWrite:
    """In `create_memory`, each guard call sits above each write statement.

    THIS ARM CLAIMS A CODE SHAPE. It does NOT claim that the guard RAN before
    the write. The guard is conditional, inside a loop behind a `continue`,
    and the write is unconditional, so a record with no list field reaches the
    write with the guard unrun and this arm stays green. That is correct
    behaviour and it shows the limit.

    FOUR LIMITS, recorded so the next reader does not over-read the green:
      1. It compares TEXT POSITION, not execution order.
      2. It is bounded to `create_memory`. A write moved into a helper leaves
         the function, the write population empties, and the length gate below
         ABORTS rather than passes.
      3. It sees a write only when the SQL is a literal that starts with a
         write verb. A statement built from a value escapes it.
      4. It cannot see a write through a connection this module does not read.
    `TestARefusedCreateWritesNothingAtAll` covers each of the four, because it
    measures the store rather than the source.

    THE SPELLING IS `max(guard) < min(write)` ON PURPOSE. Comparing the two
    nodes that happen to be found lets a SECOND write added above the guard
    pass unseen. Comparing the LAST guard against the FIRST write makes an
    early write unrepresentable rather than unseen.

    THE MUTANT IS AN EARLY WRITE, AND NOT A GUARD MOVED DOWN. The obvious
    mutant, the guard relocated below the write, IS NOT CONSTRUCTIBLE for this
    function, and the reason is worth the sentence. The guard sits IN THE DATA
    PATH OF THE WRITE: it feeds the merge, the merge assigns the normalised
    value, and the serialiser turns that value into the row the write stores.
    So a guard moved below the write changes the BYTES WRITTEN, which makes it
    a data change wearing the clothes of a reordering, and an arm proven by it
    would credit the position assertion for a failure the data caused.
    An added early write moves the position alone, so it is the mutant that
    proves this arm for its own cause.
