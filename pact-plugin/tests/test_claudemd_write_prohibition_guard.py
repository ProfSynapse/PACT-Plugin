"""Structural prose-surface regression guard for the CLAUDE.md write prohibition.

A teammate must not write a ``CLAUDE.md`` file in a project directory or a home
directory. The rule lives only in prose, in the pact-agent-teams skill body,
and the worktree boundary check allow-lists ``CLAUDE.md``, so no mechanical
control stands behind it. A later edit can narrow it back with nothing red.

THE NARROWING THIS GUARDS. The rule first said "do not edit or create". That
wording names a tool call the teammate ISSUES. It does not reach a write the
teammate CAUSES through a script, a command, or a save path it invokes, and
that indirect route is the one that produced the write. So the load-bearing
property is the ROUTE CLASS, not the presence of the rule: an edit that keeps
the prohibition and drops the route class re-opens the hole.

TWO CARRIER KINDS, AND THE SECOND IS THE ONE A TEAMMATE READS. The skill body
holds the rule for a teammate that loads the skill. The DISPATCH TEMPLATES in
``commands/`` emit their own copy of the rule into a task description, and that
copy reaches a teammate that never loads the skill body. A rule widened in the
skill alone stays narrow on the surface that carries it to its obeyer.

SLICE RULE FOR THE SKILL BODY, stated beside the assertions that use it: the
guarded region is the blockquote paragraph that opens with the bold marker
``**CLAUDE.md is not yours to write**`` and runs to the next blank line. The
slice is paragraph-bounded rather than file-bounded, so a route token sitting
in some unrelated part of the skill cannot satisfy these arms.

SLICE RULE FOR A TEMPLATE SITE, and it does different work. A template region
begins at ``TEMPLATE_START_ANCHOR`` and ends at the first
``TEMPLATE_END_ANCHOR`` after it, inclusive. It is ANCHOR-BOUNDED rather than
line-bounded, and that is load-bearing rather than a detail: a comPACT mission
is ONE physical line that also says "Do not create new documentation artifacts"
and names ``docs/``, so a line-bounded slice would let an unrelated route word
elsewhere on that line satisfy an arm. A missing anchor is a LOUD RED and not
an empty slice.

Keyed on structural tokens (semantic co-occurrence), not on exact prose, so
benign rewording survives and a narrowing fails. THE TOKEN SET HAS ONE HOME:
the same constants and the same predicates run over the skill body and over
each template region, so the two kinds of carrier cannot drift into different
definitions of the property.

  W1 — the prohibition paragraph is present and addresses the teammate.
  W2 — the paragraph carries the ROUTE CLASS: it says the rule is not limited
       to a directly-issued tool call, and it names indirect routes.
  W3 — the paragraph keeps its two bounds (target and role) and stays
       unconditional, so it does not slide back behind a worktree condition.
  W4 — each declared template site yields a region, the regions agree with
       each other, and each one satisfies W1 to W3.
  W5 — no command file names an EDITING ACT against ``CLAUDE.md`` without the
       route class. This reaches a SIXTH site on the day it is written, which
       the declared list cannot do.

WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT MEAN. The five template regions are compared to EACH
OTHER for byte agreement, and to the skill body only at the PROPERTY level.
They are paraphrases in a different frame rather than byte copies: the skill
body is a standalone blockquote and a template region sits inside a quoted
dispatch string with placeholders. A byte comparison across the two frames
would redden on each benign edit, and a guard that reddens on benign edits
trains its reader to quiet it.

THE RESIDUAL, AT ITS TRUE WIDTH. A reword of the skill body that CHANGES the
route class also changes what these shared constants require, so the template
arms redden with it. The shape no arm here catches is a skill-body reword that
KEEPS the same route class and changes the meaning some other way.
