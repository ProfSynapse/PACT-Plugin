    delete the resolution paragraph and its code block from the skill, and the
    whole suite stayed green. The pointer aimed at nothing.

    WHAT THIS KEYS ON, AND WHY NOT THE TWO OBVIOUS THINGS.

    Not the SUBCOMMAND name. A rename of it is maintenance and not breakage,
    the pointer is descriptive so a rename cannot dangle it, and
    `test_pact_harvest_cli.py` guards the name at 10 sites.

    Not the step HEADING. A heading is prose. An ordinary reword turns a
    heading pin red against correct text, and nothing else in this repository
    reads that heading.

    This keys on the code block that calls the harvest CLI and passes
    `--context-file`. A change to that flag is large, the CLI consumes it, and
    the CLI tests pin it at 8 sites. The flag appears once in the skill, so the
    predicate selects one block and not the artifact-resolution block beside it.

    MEASURED ACROSS FIVE MUTATIONS of the skill, before this pin was written:
    removal RED, subcommand rename green, `SESSION_DIR` rename green, heading
    reword green, pointer deleted RED.

    `test_index_upkeep_pointer_resolves_to_a_rule_that_exists` in

    beside it because that module has one subject, the index limits, and this
