"""Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_hook_emitted_config_root.py
Summary: Pins the config-root literals that hooks EMIT as user-facing text.
         Hook-emitted strings are prose a user or agent reads and acts on, so a
         `~/.claude/` literal in one misdirects every non-default-root install.
Used by: the merge gate only — nothing imports this module.

WHY THIS IS NOT THE PROSE GATE'S JOB: tests/test_prose_root_gate.py scans
agents/commands/skills/protocols. Extending that population to hooks/ would
sweep in ~68 docstring and comment occurrences that are documentation, not
instruction, and would need an allowlist larger than the finding. So the
population here is the EMITTED strings only, and role is decided
syntactically rather than by grep.

THE CLASSIFIER IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO PARSERS, because each is blind to
what the other sees. `ast` never contains comments at all, so a literal in the
token stream but absent from the AST is a comment BY CONSTRUCTION — no `#`
heuristics. Docstrings are named positively via the Constant at body[0].
Everything left is emitted.

TWO TRAPS THIS FILE HANDLES, both live in the files it guards:
  - an f-string is a JoinedStr, NOT a Constant. Its literal segments are
    Constant nodes nested among FormattedValue siblings, so a walk over
    top-level constants silently misses every literal inside one. `ast.walk`
    descends, which is why it is used here.
  - implicit adjacent concatenation ("a" "b") is FOLDED by ast into one
    Constant. That is what we want (we judge the RENDERED string), but it also
    means the rendered sentence is NOT a contiguous substring of the source, so
    no line-oriented grep could pin these messages.
