"""No shipped, LLM-loaded file may CONSTRUCT an agent-memory leaf.

THE RULE THIS PINS. The platform hands each agent the absolute path to its own
memory directory. The leaf is GIVEN, never derived from the agent's type name —
so a shipped instruction that spells `~/.claude/agent-memory/<some-type>/` tells
the agent to build a path the platform did not give it, and the two forms are
not always the same directory.

WHY A PIN AND NOT A SWEEP. Seven sites across three files carried a constructed
leaf. Two were found by the work that introduced the rule; the other five only
because somebody swept afterwards. A sweep is something a person has to remember;
this is a red suite.

WHAT COUNTS AS THE DEFECT — and the distinction is the whole design. The GENERIC
form `~/.claude/agent-memory/` naming the directory is CORRECT and must pass: a
shipped plugin cannot name an absolute path, so describing the location is the
only thing it can do. Only a NAMED LEAF after the slash is the defect. A pin that
forbade the generic form would refuse the correct spelling and be worse than no
pin at all.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER, stated here because a bound that lives only in a
handoff is lost at the next reading:
  * a path SPLIT ACROSS LINES — the scan is per-occurrence over the file text,
    so `agent-memory/` at the end of one line and the leaf on the next is not
    seen;
  * a leaf built by PROSE CONCATENATION — "the agent-memory directory, plus your
    agent type" constructs the same path with no slash-adjacent leaf to match;
  * a RENAMED directory — if `agent-memory` itself is spelled differently the
    scan finds nothing, which is why the liveness control below asserts the term
    still appears at all;
  * BACKSLASH separators — Windows-style paths are not matched.
The first two are the realistic gaps. Both are reachable by an author who is
paraphrasing rather than copying, which is exactly how the original seven arose.
