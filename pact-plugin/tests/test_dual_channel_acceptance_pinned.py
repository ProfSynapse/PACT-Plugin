Structural pin tests for the dual-channel acceptance rules.

Pins the reader-facing instruction surfaces that teach both channels of
teachback/HANDOFF acceptance — the notify SendMessage now carries the
canonical payload verbatim (message channel), while the raw task-metadata
read is demoted to the lead's DEFERRED audit (disk channel):

  teammate-side payload encoding (skills/pact-agent-teams/SKILL.md,
  skills/pact-teachback/SKILL.md):
    - HANDOFF-PAYLOAD-BEGIN / TEACHBACK-PAYLOAD-BEGIN delimiter tokens
      (grep-able payload boundaries in the notify templates).
    - The retired one-line-notify renderings stay retired (absence pins).
  lead-side acceptance keying (protocols/pact-completion-authority.md +
    its byte-mirrored region in protocols/pact-protocols.md):
    - T2: accept/reject on the message-carried payload; a missing or
      diverging disk copy is an integrity finding, never a basis for
      rejecting an already-acted-on submission.
    - T1 point 4: the deferred disk-vs-message audit runs at the lead's
      next turn boundary, BEFORE acting on that teammate's next
      submission.
  vocabulary (all six surfaces):
    - "deferred audit" per surface — count-free presence (no fixed
      recurrence intended), like the wake-ordering module's phrase pins.
  dispatch templates (commands/orchestrate.md):
    - both Task-A and Task-B description strings name the payload-carrying
      notify (per-site pins; the two sites carry different full phrases).
  write order + flow surface (added at TEST-phase review):
    - P10: the HANDOFF-path On Completion ordering invariant (metadata
      write → notify → intentional_wait SET) — the teachback-path twin is
      pinned in test_skill_loading_agent_teams.py; the HANDOFF-path triple
      had no pin anywhere before this case.
    - P11: the ct-teachback Flow step-3 payload-carrying-notify reference
      (extract + SSOT mirror) — its lockstep revert kept both this module
      and the byte-mirror gate green before this case.
    - P12: the payload read-back check (verify + mid-JSON write-error
      mechanism) on both teammate notify surfaces — unpinned before this
      case; the dual-channel design carries the payload on the message
      channel AND the metadata channel, and a sender-side output cut can
      truncate either one mid-JSON.
  review-remediation pins (same module, coverage-review fix):
    - P13: the summary-never-carries-payload rule (200 chars is the
      channel's ONLY truncating element) on both teammate surfaces,
      per-surface casing like P5.
    - P14: the payload END delimiter tokens — P1/P2 pin BEGIN only.
    - P15: the OTHER payload type's delimiter ABSENT per surface
      (delimiter confusion: a stray foreign BEGIN alongside the right
      one flips no presence pin).
    - P16: the deferred audit applies identically to the HANDOFF path
      (extract + SSOT mirror).
    - P17: the non-goal span — instruction-layer by necessity; reject
      future proposals to mechanize it (extract + SSOT mirror).
    - P18: the metadata-write-failure fallback — still send the
      payload-carrying notify; missing disk copy is an integrity
      finding, never a skipped submission.
    - P19: the deferred-audit repair clause — re-write from the message
      copy while it is still in your context (extract + SSOT mirror).
      The integrity_finding key NAME is deliberately unpinned: no
      reader exists in hooks or tests today, so the name is
      advisory-only until a consumer lands.
    - P20: the T2 paragraph's OPENING acceptance-keying sentence
      (extract + SSOT mirror) — hardening-audit finding: every other
      sentence of that paragraph had a witness (P3/P4/P5/P19) while the
      core "Accept or reject on the payload carried by the teammate's
      notify SendMessage" sentence had none (stubbing it alone flipped
      nothing, measured).
  rejection-direction pins (fold of the #1540 payload symmetry):
    - P21/P22: REJECTION-PAYLOAD-BEGIN / END token presence on the three
      lead-side template surfaces (completion-authority extract, its
      SSOT mirror, the orchestrator persona). The orchestrate dispatch
      template teaches the payload-carrying send by PHRASE (P23), not
      tokens — it does not carry them.
    - P23: "wake-signal SendMessage carrying the rejection payload
      verbatim" on the orchestrate dispatch template, the persona's
      rejection-path paragraph, and the teachback skill's On-rejection
      cross-ref (one span satisfies all three surfaces).
    - P24: the teammate-side reading instruction — the agent-teams On
      Rejection step 2 header span naming the field-labeled block and
      its four fields.
    - P25: "the disk copy is confirmation, not the primary" (per-surface
      casing: lowercase on completion-authority, the SSOT, and the
      agent-teams intro; sentence-initial capital on the agent-teams
      step 2).
    - P26: the integrity_finding advisory ruling — advisory by design,
      no automated reader consumes it, the lead records and acts.
    - P27: the retired pointer-format SendMessages ("See
      metadata.teachback_rejection" / "See metadata.handoff_rejection")
      absent from every LLM-loaded instruction surface, tree-wide.

Inherited vocabulary guard (P9, no new case here): the NEW lead-side
prose is covered by the existing retired-"wake-send"/"wake send" absence
pin in test_wake_ordering_pinned.py, already parametrized over
completion-authority, the SSOT region, and the orchestrator persona —
the three surfaces this change edits lead-side. Reintroducing the retired
send-term through the new wording trips that pin; nothing here duplicates
it.

PRESENCE pins, not counts. None of these phrases is intended to recur a
fixed number of times per surface, so count pins would add
lockstep-maintenance cost without catching a real erosion shape. (The
Read-Trigger marker phrase keeps its own EXPECTED_COUNTS lockstep in
test_read_trigger_precondition_pinned.py; this change deliberately does
NOT quote that phrase — paraphrase keeps those counts byte-stable.)

PHRASES, not line shapes. Matching is backtick-and-whitespace-normalized
(see _phrase: strip backticks, then " ".join(text.split())) per the
wake-ordering convention — re-wrapping and inline-code rendering survive,
a re-WORD does not. Matching is CASE-SENSITIVE by design; the "deferred
audit" pin set uses per-surface casing (the completion-authority extract
and its SSOT mirror carry the T2 sentence's uppercase "DEFERRED audit",
every other surface carries the lowercase mid-sentence form) — do not
normalize case to unify them.

P4 anchoring rationale (phantom-green guard, same shape as the
wake-ordering postdating pin): the T2 sentence on the same surface
contains the LOWERCASE span "before acting on that teammate's next
submission". A case-insensitive or shorter pin would be satisfied by T2
alone and stay green if T1's point 4 regressed; the uppercase anchored
long form exists only at point 4.

Counter-test-by-revert (verified at authoring time, measured in a TEMP
COPY of the plugin tree — the live worktree is never mutated): with each
edited file individually restored to its pre-change state
(git show <pre-change-ref>:<path> over the copy) and this module run
against the copy, exactly that file's P-cases fail. The measured flip-set
per file and the total are recorded in the module-level comment at the
bottom of this file.

#     matches 0 lines), NOT on the co-occurrence assert. The co-occurrence

#     the only case that sees it.
#   source-only revert of the class-C commit
#                                        -> 12 failed (P31 x11, plus P32's

#     commit is LATER than the class-C commit on two shared files, so
#     restoring them at the class-C parent also un-widens the blindness
#     claim. Not an arm defect — an artifact of checking out an ancestor ref
#     on a file later commits also touched.
#   revert of the orphaned-label commit   -> 1 failed (P31, the
#     HANDOFF-presence case; the two agent-teams spans pin successive states
#     of the SAME line, so each commit reddens exactly its own)
#   source-only revert of the narrow-5 commit
#                                        -> 2 failed (P32 x2; the positive
#     control still passes, since the narrow form contains the canonical one)
#   P32's positive control pointed at a phrase absent from the tree
#                                        -> both P32 cases fail ON THE
#     CONTROL assert, reporting 0 of 70 surfaces against a floor of 10. An
#     instrument check, not a tree mutation: it proves the control fires, so
#     a sweep that has stopped matching reports as broken rather than clean.
