"""The agent_handoff dedup key must DISCRIMINATE on handoff content.

WHAT THIS FILE COVERS THAT THE REST OF THE FAMILY DOES NOT, AND IT IS MEASURED
RATHER THAN FEARED. Two mutation passes forced the content term of the marker
key to a CONSTANT and left the whole handoff-family suite GREEN. The cause is
one cause: every other expectation in the family derives the key it predicts by
CALLING handoff_content_key, the function the mutant changes, so the expectation
moves with the mutant and the two agree. Those assertions guard the SHAPE of the
key. This file guards that the key DISCRIMINATES.

NOT ONE ASSERTION BELOW CALLS handoff_content_key OR occupant_hash. Every
expectation is derived a second way: from the RELATION between two marker
filenames written by two fires, and from the character class and width of each
segment. A mutant cannot drag those along with it.

THE TWO SURVIVING MUTANTS MOVE THE KEY IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS, AND ONE ARM
CANNOT CATCH BOTH.
  - A CONSTANT content term makes FEWER keys distinct. It dies to the REVISION
    arm, which asserts that two DIFFERENT handoffs give TWO events.
  - A KEY-ORDER-SENSITIVE serialization makes MORE keys distinct. It SURVIVES
    the revision arm and dies only to the SUPPRESSION arm, which asserts that
    two insertion orders of ONE handoff give ONE event.
  - A term that VARIES FOR EACH CALL without tracking content also makes more
    keys distinct, and also dies to the suppression arm. Proof that a key is
    not constant is not proof that the key tracks content.
  - A term keyed on the LENGTH of the canonical bytes is GREEN on the revision
    arm and GREEN on the suppression arm. It varies, it does not track
    content, and it collides for two DIFFERENT handoffs of EQUAL canonical
    length. Only an arm that holds the length CONSTANT and changes the content
    can see it, which is why TestEqualLengthContentStillDiscriminates exists.

WHY A SUPPRESSION ARM NEEDS ITS OWN CONTROL. An assertion that a count equals 1
passes for free if the second fire never reaches the marker layer at all, so a
broken fixture and a working dedup produce the same bytes. Each suppression arm
below therefore asserts the SET OF MARKER FILENAMES ON DISK, and then drives a
THIRD fire with genuinely different content that MUST emit. A dead fixture
cannot pass that third leg.

WHY THE FIRST-SET ARM SHIPS BESIDE THE REVISION ARM. A zero from a suppressed
emit and a zero from a broken fixture are also the same bytes. The first-set arm
pins that ONE post-completion write gives exactly one event, so the TWO in the
revision arm is caused by the second write and not by a fixture that doubles.

THE BOUND ON WHAT THIS FILE ESTABLISHES, AND IT IS A LIMIT ON THE CLAIM RATHER
THAN A NOTE BESIDE IT. NO FINITE ARM SET ESTABLISHES THAT THE CONTENT TERM IS
KEYED ON CONTENT. A term that hashes a PROJECTION of the content passes every
arm whose pair differs in that projection, and the projections do not run out.
These arms kill EIGHT NAMED PROJECTIONS: constant, canonical length, key set,
key count, byte prefix, byte suffix, values-only, and byte sum. A projection
outside that list is not covered by this file. See
TestContentProjectionsThatCollide for the rule that builds an arm for a
projection nobody has named.

    WHY THIS ARM IS NOT COVERED BY THE TWO ARMS ABOVE, AND IT WAS MEASURED.
    A content term keyed on the LENGTH of the canonical bytes varies, and it
    does not track content. It passes the revision arm, because the two
    handoffs there are 49 and 57 canonical bytes and a length key separates
    them. It passes the suppression arm, because two insertion orders of one
    mapping have equal length and therefore agree, which is the correct
    verdict reached for an incorrect cause.

    So the length-keyed term suppresses a REVISION THAT HOLDS ITS LENGTH, and
    that is the loss the whole repair exists to remove. This arm holds the
    length CONSTANT and changes the content, which is the one shape that
    separates a length key from a content key.

    FOUR ROUTES BY WHICH THIS ARM CAN GO GREEN FOR A CAUSE THAT IS NOT CONTENT
    DISCRIMINATION. Each has a guard in the body below, and the guards are
    numbered to this list.
      1. THE PAIR DRIFTS TO DIFFERENT LENGTHS. Then the arm passes because the
         lengths differ, which reproduces the revision arm and adds nothing.
      2. THE OCCUPANT TERM DIFFERS BETWEEN THE TWO WRITES. Then the key differs
         on the occupant term and two events appear no matter what the content
         term does.
      3. THE TWO WRITES DO NOT SHARE A MARKER DIRECTORY. Then dedup is
         impossible, two events appear against EVERY mutant, and the arm is
         green by construction. THIS IS THE ROUTE THAT HIDES BEST, because the
         arm looks correct and reddens for nothing.

        `P(p) == P(q)` AND `p != q`.

    A term that hashes a PROJECTION of the content rather than the content
    passes every arm whose pair happens to differ in that projection. So to

    DIFFERS IN CONTENT. That construction works for a projection nobody has
    named yet, which is why the rule is recorded here and not only the
    projections it produced.

    NO FINITE ARM SET ESTABLISHES THAT THE TERM IS KEYED ON CONTENT, because
    the projections do not run out. Each arm in this file kills one NAMED
    projection and says nothing about a projection outside that list.

    ONE PAIR DOES NOT KILL THE TWO PROJECTIONS BELOW, which is why this is two
    arms. MEASURED: the rename pair agrees on values and DIFFERS in byte sum,
    and the permute pair agrees on byte sum and DIFFERS in values.

    HOW TO MIS-APPLY THE RULE ABOVE, AND IT IS THE WAY A CAREFUL READER WILL.
    THE RULE IS ABOUT A PAIR, AND AN ARM IS NOT ALWAYS ONE PAIR. An arm that
    carries a THIRD write, such as a positive-control leg, kills projections
    that its NOMINAL pair does not predict. So map the rule onto the WRITES in
    an arm, and not onto the arm.

    MEASURED INSTANCE, from the work that produced this file. By hand across
    the pairs here, a key-set-keyed term was predicted to die to 2 arms. The
    mutant measured 4 red. The difference is the suppression arm in this same
    file, of which the third write shares a key set with its first two and
    differs in content.

    🔴 THE DIRECTION IS WHAT MAKES THIS A WARNING RATHER THAN A NOTE. A
    hand-application of the rule predicts FEWER kills than occur, so the error
    runs in the SAFE direction. Nobody investigates a projection that turned

        A set-valued handoff raises TypeError, and a handler named
        `(TypeError, ValueError)` absorbs it, so that arm passes under EITHER
        handler width and reports no difference between them. This arm drives
        a raise from OUTSIDE that pair, which the named handler lets escape
        into the emit path's bare except, where the event vanishes with no
        record. It therefore separates the two handlers: wide gives 1 event,
        named gives 0.

        WHY THE RAISE IS PATCHED AND NOT BUILT FROM A DEEP OBJECT. The
        genuine producer is RecursionError from a deeply nested mapping, and
        json.loads parses such a mapping without error, so the value does
        arrive through the JSON-parsed metadata the emit paths receive.
        THE DEPTH THAT REACHES THE RAISE CARRIES THREE PARAMETERS, AND ALL
        THREE ARE NAMED HERE ON PURPOSE. A parameter left implicit reads as
        a detail, and a reader who meets it as a detail does not check it.

            INTERPRETER   NOT the axis. STRUCK. An earlier record here named
                          the interpreter version, and a bisection falsified
                          it. Do not restore that wording.
            THREAD STACK  the axis, MEASURED BY BISECTION, moving the
                          threshold by more than 50x:
                            main thread, default   depth 64901 to 66460
                            thread stack 512 KiB   depth 1000 to 2558
                            thread stack 32 MiB    depth 130362 to 131921
                          `sys.getrecursionlimit()` read 1000 in all three
                          and predicted NONE of them, so do not size a
                          fixture against the recursion limit either.
            CONTAINER     MEASURED: a 100000-deep nested MAPPING raises, and
                          a 100000-deep nested LIST does NOT raise on the
                          same interpreter. The word "mapping" above is
                          load-bearing and is not decoration. A reader who
                          probes with a list fails to reproduce this record
                          and can discard it as stale, which is worse than
                          an absent record: the next reader re-derives it
                          and trusts the re-derivation less.

        A fixture pinned to a depth stops reaching the raise on a TOPOLOGY
        change and not merely on a version change, and it stops in the
        SILENT direction: the arm keeps passing while it drives an ordinary
        serialization. The 512 KiB row is what makes that sharp. At that
        stack the threshold falls to a few thousand, which is about 6 KiB of
        JSON, an ORDINARY payload. Carry no size without its parameters: the
        main-thread row is about 380 KiB of JSON at (main thread, default
        stack, mapping).

        The patch targets the name bound in agent_handoff_marker, because
        that module imports canonical_bytes by value and a patch of the
        defining module would not be the object it calls.
