"""The canary checklist states a check count that an instrument reads.

WHY THIS ARM IS THE REPAIR AND THE CORRECTED NUMBER IS NOT. The checklist said
the extract gate performs 16 checks. It performs 19. Correcting the digit fixes
today and repairs nothing: A PROSE CLAIM THAT NO INSTRUMENT READS GOES STALE IN
SILENCE, and the silence is the defect. Somebody adds a call to the script, no
test reads the checklist, and a reviewer follows a number that describes a
script from before.

THE POPULATION COMES FROM WHAT THE SCRIPT DID, NOT FROM ITS SOURCE TEXT, AND
THAT CHOICE IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE. The obvious rule is to count the `verify`
call sites with a regular expression over the script. THAT RULE IS DEFECTIVE
AND IT WAS MEASURED DEFECTIVE ON THIS BRANCH, in two directions that a reader
of the rule cannot see:
  1. A line at COLUMN ZERO inside an ordinary heredoc, for example a usage
     message that shows a sample invocation, is counted as a call. The script
     is correct, and the count is one too high.
  2. Changing the first argument of each call from double to single quotes is
     identical to bash and makes the rule match NOTHING. The count falls to
     zero, which reads as a broken harness rather than as a defect in the rule.
  3. THE LARGEST OF THE THREE, AND IT IS RECORDED WITH ITS NUMBERS BECAUSE A
     READER WHO MEETS ONLY THE FIRST TWO CAN CONCLUDE THE SOURCE-TEXT RULE IS
     NEARLY CORRECT. It is not nearly correct. The counter increments at 5
     source sites in `verify-task-hierarchy.sh` and at 10 in
     `verify-worktree-protocol.sh`, and those two scripts emit 28 and 20. The
     increments sit inside helpers called many times, so a source-text count is
     wrong by more than five times on the first script and by two times on the
     second. Cases 1 and 2 are off by one and by everything. THIS ONE IS OFF BY
     A FACTOR, AND IT IS THE ORDINARY CASE RATHER THAN AN EDGE.
A shell script is not reliably parsed by a line-oriented pattern. NEITHER a
line at column zero, NOR a quote style, NOR a helper called many times can
change what a script EMITS when it runs, so the run is the sound source.

THE TWO SIDES ARE INDEPENDENT, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THE COMPARISON EVIDENCE. One
side is a document a person maintains by hand. The other is the behaviour of a
script at run time. They can disagree, and the whole point is that they DO
disagree when somebody edits one alone. Nothing here derives both sides from
one source, which would make the comparison a tautology that always holds.

WHY `Passed + Failed` AND NOT `Passed`. The sum is the number of comparisons
the script performed. A genuinely failing extract moves a unit from one column
to the other and leaves the sum alone, so this arm stays on its own subject: it
counts CHECKS, and a byte difference between an extract and its section is the
subject of the extract-gate arms in `test_audit_protocol.py`.

SCOPE, STATED BECAUSE THE CHECKLIST CARRIES FOUR SUCH ROWS. ALL FOUR ARE ARMED
IN THIS MODULE, and the three classes below split on the RULE each row states,
not on the script it names:
  - THE EXTRACT-GATE ROW states a count plus a POSITIVE rule that gives the
    count, and that rule names a population in the SCRIPT SOURCE. First class.
  - THE SCOPE-INTEGRITY ROW states a count plus a FORMULA across a population
    on the FILESYSTEM, so its number moves and a third source is necessary.
    Second class.
  - THE TASK-HIERARCHY AND WORKTREE-PROTOCOL ROWS state a count plus a NEGATIVE
    DECLARATION OF FIXEDNESS. The rule names NO population. It asserts that no
    population is available, so no third source is necessary and the cheaper
    two-source comparison is sound. Third class, parametrized across the two.
A reader who expects one shape for each row will look for four classes and find
three. The count of classes follows the count of RULE SHAPES.

THE AXIS THESE ARMS CANNOT SEE. They count comparisons, not what each
comparison compares. A call that names the wrong heading pair is counted here
and caught by the byte comparison inside the script, which the exit-code arm in
`test_audit_protocol.py` reports.

    WHY THIS ROW COULD NOT BE ARMED THE WAY THE ROW ABOVE IS. That row states a
    fixed number, so a run alone settles it. This one states a count that MOVES
    with the number of files in `pact-plugin/agents/`, so a fixed number would
    be incorrect the next time somebody adds an agent, and nothing would say so.

    THREE INDEPENDENT SOURCES, AND NO TWO OF THEM READ FROM ONE PLACE. That
    independence is the whole argument, because two shapes that look like this
    arm are UNSOUND and were rejected before it was written:
      SOURCE A, THE THING UNDER TEST: the checklist's stated RULE, which is
        hand-maintained prose. Two quantities come from it, the fixed-check
        count and the size of the skip set. Nothing derives them.
      SOURCE B: the number of `*.md` files in `pact-plugin/agents/`, read from
        the filesystem at run time.
      SOURCE C: the comparisons `verify-scope-integrity.sh` performed, read out
        of its own summary block after a real run.
    The arm predicts C from A and B, and compares. A never reads the script and
    never reads the directory. C never reads the checklist. So the two sides of
    the comparison have no common ancestor and CAN disagree.

    THE TWO UNSOUND SHAPES, RECORDED SO NEITHER IS RE-PROPOSED AS A SIMPLER
    ALTERNATIVE:
      1. Deriving the formula from the SCRIPT SOURCE puts both sides of the
         comparison on one source, which is a tautology that always holds. It
         is also defective for the second cause the module docstring records: a
         shell script is not reliably parsed by a line-oriented pattern.
      2. Hardcoding the fixed-check count in this file mints a STALE TWIN. The
         number would then live in two places and a later editor would correct
         one of them.

    WHAT THIS ARM DELIBERATELY DOES NOT ASSERT, AND THE REASON IS AN OVER-BLOCK
    IT WOULD OTHERWISE BECOME. The row's bracketed total and its "that directory
    holds N files" are a WORKED EXAMPLE, a snapshot of one day. The row itself
    tells a reader who sees a different number to count the agent files before
    reporting a defect. If this arm compared the stated TOTAL against the run,
    then ADDING AN AGENT FILE would redden it, and the arm would fight correct
    growth rather than catch a defect. So the snapshot numbers are checked only
    for internal arithmetic, by the separate arm at the end of this class, and
    the two hand-maintained quantities are the ones checked against the world.

    THE SENSITIVITY THIS ARM CARRIES ON PURPOSE. The predicted term subtracts
    the STATED skip count from the REAL directory count, which assumes each
    skipped agent file is present in that directory. Removing one of the skipped
    agent files reddens this arm. That is the correct direction: the stated skip
    claim would then describe a set the directory no longer holds. Reading the
    `case` statement instead would remove the sensitivity and reintroduce
    unsound shape 1, so the sensitivity is kept and stated rather than fixed.

    THE RULE THESE TWO ROWS STATE IS A THIRD SHAPE, AND NAMING IT IS WHAT MAKES
    THE CHEAP COMPARISON SOUND. Each row states a count and then declares "FIXED
    count: no check comes from the contents of a directory". That is not the
    positive rule the extract-gate row states, and it is not the formula the
    scope-integrity row states. IT NAMES NO POPULATION AT ALL. It asserts that
    none is available. A number that its own rule says does not move needs no
    third source, so these two rows take the two-source comparison: the stated
    count against `Passed + Failed` from a real run.

    THE DECLARATION WAS VERIFIED BY RUN, NOT BY READING THE ROW. An unverified
    absence is the weakest claim a document can carry, so it was driven: a
    command file and a skill directory were added in an isolated copy of the
    tree, and the two scripts emitted 28 and 20 both before and after. Neither
    count tracks a directory. A static read agreed, and the run is what settles
    it.

    WHAT THIS CLASS DOES NOT CHECK, AND THE LIMIT IS DELIBERATE. It checks THE
    NUMBER. It does NOT check the negative declaration itself. To check the
    declaration means searching the script source for a glob, which is the
    source-text instrument the module docstring records as defective in three
    directions, and a false negative there is SILENT. A silent miss on a guard
    is worse than a documented gap, so the gap is documented here and the guard
    is not built.

    THAT LIMIT HAS A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE READER, AND THE FAILURE MESSAGE CARRIES
    IT. If a script later gains a directory-derived population, this arm reds,
    which is correct. But the row it sends the reader to says the count is
    fixed, and that sentence is incorrect at that moment. A reader who trusts
    the row diagnoses "a check was lost" and hunts for a deletion that never
    happened. So the message names BOTH causes and lets the reader take the
    fork. It cannot decide between them, and it does not pretend to.

    THESE ARMS CANNOT FLAKE, AND THAT WAS MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. Neither
    script reads a clock, sleeps, uses a random value, or calls the network.
    Neither writes to disk, so parallel execution cannot corrupt the input of
    another test. The working directory is passed explicitly. Measured run
    times are about 0.32 s and 0.08 s. The one way these arms red without a
    defect is a concurrent edit to a file the scripts read, which is a true
    report about the tree rather than an unstable test.
