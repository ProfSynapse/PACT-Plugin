    On `"no"`/`"concern"` every one of these surfaces tells the lead to prefer
    ORCHESTRATOR-SIDE CORRECTION — re-stamp with refined per-dimension
    rationales. On a dispatch stamped WITHHELD that instruction writes the
    hypothesis the withholding exists to keep out, and the seat files `concern`
    on such a dispatch BY CONSTRUCTION, so the input is not hypothetical.

    WHAT THIS CHECKS, stated narrowly because an earlier form of this arm was
    GREEN OVER THIS DEFECT LIVE IN THE TREE: four literals present at each of
    the three surfaces, plus an ORDERING fact — where a surface states the
    preference and the exception in one prose line, the exception must come
    LAST. Presence alone could not see the defect, because the defect ADDED an
    unqualified preference sentence after the clause rather than removing
    anything, and presence sees absence, not contradiction. And on the two
    NESTED surfaces, that the exception is the FIRST corrective-options bullet,
    so an option is never offered before it is forbidden — reordering the list
    to present the options first reddens. Only the bullet COUNT was dropped;
    the ORDER is still pinned.

    WHAT IT STILL CANNOT DO. It cannot check that a reader OBEYS. Beyond that,
    THREE KNOWN shapes pass — known, not all; the class-level paragraph
    below is what classifies a fourth nobody has built yet:
    1. THE SYNONYM. A re-instruction that says re-stamp WITHOUT spending the
       word — "refresh the per-dimension rationales", say.
    2. THE REGION EXIT. A TOP-LEVEL bullet placed past the blockquote is
       outside the censused range and passes carrying the word. Measured with a
       positional control: identical text at the same line, indented to stay
       inside the region, reddens.
    3. THE COMPENSATING PAIR, below.
    CARRIERS INSIDE THE REGION ARE COVERED — appended prose, the next line, a
    deeper bullet, an indented blockquote (this file's own house style, four
    lines below in the protocols) — each reddening WITH the word and passing
    WITHOUT it. That is what the census bought, and it is narrower than "every
    positional variant", which is what this docstring said until it was
    measured. WHICH FAILURE EACH LEG OWNS, because the census is NOT strictly better than
    what it replaced and treating it that way is how the next hole gets made.
    An ordering pin is blind to a SUBSTITUTION and catches a MOVE; a census is
    the reverse. CONSTRUCTED, not observed in the wild: the COMPENSATING PAIR —
    add a re-instruction that spends the word, delete one legitimate mention in
    the same region — keeps the count at 3 and passes GREEN. No widening of the
    pattern can reach it, because nothing was evaded; the arithmetic was paid.
    Its plausibility is raised, not established, by the close-bullet case: ONE
    innocent edit perturbs this count by a mechanism its author did not
    consider, so the count is coupled to layout in ways an ordinary editor
    cannot see. The redesign traded one
    blind spot for another, deliberately, because a move is cheap to make by
    accident and a compensating pair is not.

    TWO STRUCTURAL DECLARATIONS, neither chased:
    - THE REGION IS DERIVED FROM THE CONTENT IT POLICES. `end` is the next line
      starting "- " or "#", so a top-level bullet placed far enough after the
      exception is outside the region BY CONSTRUCTION and evades. Placed close,
      it instead truncates the range and lowers the count — which is why the
      failure message prints the line range and says a LOW count usually means
      the region shrank rather than a mention being deleted.
    - THE 3 IS THREE UNRELATED SENTENCES, one of them the `> ⚠️` re-stamp
      mechanics warning that has nothing to do with the exception. So an
      ordinary edit to that warning reddens this arm. The message says to repair
      the text and NOT to bump the number, because re-pinning the count to
      whatever the tree now says is exactly how a live re-instruction is adopted.
      Tighten-back trigger, the same contract MAX_SKILL_CHARS carries in
      test_agents_structure.py: if a re-instruction is REMOVED from this region,
      LOWER this number. Do NOT raise it. A constant that only ever goes up
      stops being a ceiling, which is the argument this branch already made
      once tonight about a character budget and then paid for by trimming.

    NOTHING GUARDS THE REGION'S EXTENT. A top-level bullet contracted the range
    from [217,228) to [217,224) — seven lines of the corrective-options block
    fell outside the censused text and the arm stayed GREEN, because the
    truncation dropped no counted occurrence. Coverage shrank and no number the
    assertion reads moved.

    Also uncaught, deliberately: a fourth bullet that adds no re-stamp
    wording — its COUNT only, since the exception's position in that list
    is still pinned above.
    That is the price of dropping a bullet-count leg which was brittle to a
    legitimate fourth bullet AND porous to an indented one — paying for
    brittleness without buying coverage. The ordering leg keys on two literal
    preference markers; an ordinary rewording of either makes the loop find nothing, which is why the
    vacuity guard below fails LOUD instead of passing on an empty check. The
    nested-list surfaces get their subordination from layout, so the ordering
    leg is expected to bind on the flat prose surface only.
