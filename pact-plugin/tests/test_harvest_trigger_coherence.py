"""Harvest dispatch sites are the oracle for the prose enumerations of them.

COVERED, and this list is the scope — an enumeration not on it is not gated:
the orchestrator persona's trigger rows, the harvest skill's variant bullets,
and the skill's Consolidation trigger sentence. Each of those is compared
against the dispatch sites, never against another prose surface: completing one
of these lists is what shortens the others, so chaining them would route that
pressure into the oracle.

NOT gated here, and deliberately: the persona's propagation paragraph. It claims
which boundaries PROPAGATE, a different property from which run a Consolidation,
and ``test_exemption_policy_tripwires.py`` compares it against the dispatches
that carry the propagate sentence.

Before adding an arm here, check whether the enumeration you are gating is
coupled to one that is not. A partial gate over coupled lists manufactures the
desync it cannot see, and reports green in the same run.


The dispatch sites in ``commands/`` are the ground truth: each one tells the
secretary to follow a named harvest workflow, so the pair (command, variant) is
a fact about what the repository does. The orchestrator persona's trigger list
and the harvest skill's variant list are CLAIMS about those pairs. This module
asserts the claims equal the facts, in both directions, so adding a dispatch
without listing it and listing a trigger with no dispatch each redden.

BOUND, stated because it is narrower than the assertion looks: the multiset
counts dispatch sites, it does not identify them. Two distinct boundaries and
one boundary dispatched twice are the same count, so the gate reddens on the
second and the fix is to enumerate it — which is the right outcome either way.
A dispatch site carrying no ``Follow the <Variant> Harvest workflow`` string is
invisible here; give a new one that string or this gate cannot see it.

EXTRACTION RULE, stated because an under-matching extractor yields a green that
proves nothing and every local step of building it looks correct:

  * ground truth -- every ``Follow the <Variant> Harvest workflow`` in a
    ``commands/*.md``, paired with that file's stem. Several dispatch sites may
    yield the same pair, and THE TWO SURFACES COUNT THEM DIFFERENTLY because
    they claim different things. The persona enumerates BOUNDARIES, one row
    each, so it compares as a MULTISET: two boundaries in one command are two
    rows. The skill maps a variant to the commands that use it, so it compares
    as a SET: naming a command twice there would be wrong. A single unit for
    both surfaces is what let a second dispatch site hide.
  * persona -- every line of the Memory Processing Triggers block naming a
    variant with an arrow AND a backticked command.
  * skill -- every variant bullet's parenthesised comma list of commands.

Extraction reads whole file text, never line by line: a dispatch ``description=``
string spans many lines, so a line-oriented scan sees fragments of it.

Each source is asserted NON-EMPTY before the sets are compared. Two empty sets
are equal, so a comparison over a failed extraction would pass while measuring
nothing.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CATCH: whether a dispatch fires at the workflow boundary its
prose claims. The pair is (command, variant); the boundary within the command is
prose with no machine-readable counterpart, so moving a harvest earlier or later
inside the same command changes nothing here.

    compare a padded set. And multiplicity is wrong: a command with two trigger
