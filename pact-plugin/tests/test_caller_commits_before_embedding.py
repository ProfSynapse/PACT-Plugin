Summary: Arms for an invariant that three reviewers reached independently and
none of them could pin. The connection-wide `conn.rollback()` in
`_store_embedding` DISCARDS NOTHING, because each writer on that connection
commits its own work first. So the write path is correct BECAUSE OF A
PROPERTY OF ITS CALLERS, and nothing held that property. A later author who
moves a commit, or tidies one away as redundant, arms a data loss and the
suite stays green.

WHY THESE ARMS ARE BEHAVIOURAL AND NOT STATIC. The commits sit in DIFFERENT
FUNCTIONS AND DIFFERENT FILES from the call they protect. `save` opens the
connection, calls `create_memory`, which commits inside `database.py`, calls
`link_memory_to_paths`, which commits PER LINK inside `graph.py`, and then
calls `_store_embedding`. A position arm inside one function cannot express a
commit two frames down in another module, and a transitive walk of the call
graph must model cross-module dispatch, which an alias defeats.

THE PRECONDITION THESE ARMS REST ON IS ITSELF ARMED, ELSEWHERE AND ON
PURPOSE. A rollback that discards nothing for an unrelated reason would make
each arm below pass whether or not the callers commit. That is measured in
`test_connection_transaction_mode.py`: the factory opens in
implicit-transaction mode and a rollback discards uncommitted work, on each
driver that ships. READ THAT MODULE FIRST. If it goes red, treat every green
here as unproven rather than as evidence.

A BOUND ON THE INJECTION, RECORDED SO A LATER READER DOES NOT OVER-READ
THESE ARMS. The failure comes from an ABSENT vector table rather than
from a patch inside the subject, which is the right construction: a patch
in the function under test would make the arm test the patch. It does
mean these arms certify THE ORDERING, and not the behaviour of the fault
handler for one particular exception class. Any exception that reaches
the rollback proves the ordering, which is the whole invariant, so the
bound costs nothing here. DO NOT read these arms as evidence about the
handler. They are not that.

THE RESIDUAL, NAMED RATHER THAN ARMED. These arms cover the callers that
exist. A FUTURE NEW CALLER that writes on this connection without committing
first is NOT covered, and no behavioural arm can reach it, because no test
can exercise a caller that is not written yet. The forward half of the
invariant is not soundly testable at this level. It is recorded here rather
than papered over with an arm that would test its own fixture.
