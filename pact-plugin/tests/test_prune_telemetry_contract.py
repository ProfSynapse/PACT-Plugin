"""The prose<->journal-registry seam for /PACT:prune-memory telemetry.

THIS TEST DELIBERATELY SPANS TWO OWNERS, and that is the reason it exists
rather than an awkwardness to apologise for.

`commands/prune-memory.md` (command prose) EMITS journal events.
`hooks/shared/session_journal.py` (Python) VALIDATES them. Neither file's
own test suite can see the other: the suites reading the prose carry no
`session_journal` import, and the suites exercising the registry never read
the prose. So the contract between them was correct only BY INSPECTION --
a rename, a field change or a typo on either side would drift silently,
with both suites green.

That is the same shape as two defects already found in this feature's CODE
phase: a contract spanning two agents' file boundaries, invisible from
inside either scope by construction. A test that belongs to neither owner
is the only kind that can hold it.

WHAT THIS DOES *NOT* COVER, stated so a later reader does not over-trust it:
the `outcome` VALUE set (`cancelled` / `no_candidates` / `unknown_state` /
`archive_refused` / `unverified_eviction`) has NO single source of truth.
`_REQUIRED_FIELDS_BY_TYPE` types `outcome` as `str`, not as a value set, and
the writer is not enum-gated -- so `outcome="banana"` validates green today.
Pinning those five strings HERE would mint a THIRD source of truth (prose,
this test, and nowhere authoritative) rather than connect two, so it is
deliberately not done. Tracked as a named residual; the fix is to constrain
the value set at the registry, which is where a value-set contract belongs.
