Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_concurrent_auditor_wake.py
Summary: Four pins guarding the concurrent-auditor wake fix. A concurrent
         auditor dispatched before its coders produce output went idle and
         never woke, so a mandated quality gate was lost in silence. The fix
         relays a wake from the orchestrator on coder stage-ready, replaces
         the instruction that caused the wait, corrects the protocol paragraph
         that authorised proceeding without the audit, and adds a phase-exit
         coverage check.

         Pin 1  the wait instruction never ships without naming the wake
         Pin 2  the orchestrator is instructed to send that wake
         Pin 3  the auditor is told not to end its turn depending on a
                background process
         Pin 4  the repo fact the guidance asserts is true of this repo:
                no PACT hook can deliver a message

WHAT THESE PINS DO NOT ESTABLISH -- read this before trusting a green run.

  Pins 1-3 are TIER 1. They establish that specific text is present or
  absent, that a required clause co-occurs with the instruction it qualifies
  at a pinned cardinality, and that the surfaces carrying it do not drift
  apart. They establish NOTHING about behaviour. In particular they do not
  establish that any agent reading the instruction acts on it.

  Every Tier-1 pin here is LITERAL-anchored. It cannot see a semantically
  equivalent PARAPHRASE introduced at a NEW site. This is not theoretical:
  the Phase C trigger already exhibits it, at literal occupancy 1 against
  semantic occupancy 3. Cardinality catches a paraphrase that REPLACES a
  known site; nothing here catches one that is ADDED elsewhere.

  Pin 4 is TIER 2. It establishes that a factual claim the shipped text makes
  is true of this repo at test time -- strictly more than presence, and still
  not behaviour. Its own limits are documented on the class.

  There is no coverage percentage. For a prose surface the number would
  itself be the overstatement.

Used by: pact-plugin test suite (standing merge gate).

class TestWaitInstructionCarriesTheWake:
    """The instruction to wait must always name what ends the wait.

    The defect had two halves. One surface told the auditor to wait and named
    no wake at all; a second told the lead that an absent audit signal means
    "not written yet, never no signal". An auditor that waits without a named
    wake is the failure, so the property worth pinning is a CONJUNCTION: every
    surviving wait instruction also names the relay that ends it.

    A bare conjunction is not enough, and the reason is the whole point of this
    class. "Every occurrence of X also carries Y" is vacuously TRUE when there
    are zero occurrences of X, so DELETING the instruction would pass it in
    silence. Cardinality is what closes that door.

    The cardinality is 2, and it is exact. Post-fix the wait phrase survives
    only in the two protocol copies; the agent body is a full replacement that
    names the relay instead of instructing a bare wait. Exactness is
    load-bearing rather than stylistic, and it can be checked: a floor of >= 2
    is TRUE before the fix (3 sites) and TRUE after (2 sites), so a floor
    cannot observe the change at all. Exact-2 is FALSE before and TRUE after.
    Use the weakest predicate that still discriminates -- here nothing weaker
    than exactness does.

class TestNoPactHookCanDeliverAMessage:
    """The claim "no PACT hook sends a message" is TRUE of this repo.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH, and the first item is the important one:

    1. The instruction's force rests on a CONJUNCTION -- PACT provides no wake
       AND the platform provides none. This pin covers the PACT conjunct only.
       If the platform later gained wake-on-process-exit, the pinned sentence
       would remain TRUE and this pin would stay GREEN while the guidance
       became misleading. Named, not closed; it is not pytest-testable.

    2. SEND_CALLEE_NAMES and MOVE_CALLEES are ENUMERATIONS the author wrote,
       and there is no Python send-message callable in this repo to calibrate
       the first against. The fixture proves the scanner runs and flags -- it
       validates the PIPELINE, not the PATTERN. Delivery routed through an
       indirection an enumeration does not anticipate (a subprocess
       invocation, a dynamically-built attribute, a helper in a module the
       sweep does not cover) would not be caught. Read a green here as "no
       delivery construct of a KNOWN SHAPE", never as proof of impossibility.

    3. Taint propagation is intra-module, assignment-based, and FLOW-
       INSENSITIVE. A path passed through a function boundary and written on
       the far side is not tracked. Within a module the taint set is FLAT --
       there is no per-function scoping, so a name tainted in one function
       taints the same identifier everywhere in that module. That is the safe
       direction (it over-approximates), but it means a finding's location is
       evidence about the module, not proof about the enclosing function.
       Tuple targets ARE tracked, and over-approximately: `fd, tmp =
       mkstemp(dir=inbox_dir)` taints both names though only one is a path.

    4. The move rule is keyed on the dotted (module, attr) pairs in
       MOVE_CALLEES, so `from os import replace; replace(tmp, inbox)` and the
       pathlib method forms `tmp.rename(inbox)` / `tmp.replace(inbox)` are NOT
       caught. Nor is the splat form `os.replace(*args)`: the destination is
       read positionally, and a starred argument collapses to a single
       ast.Starred node, so `len(call.args) >= 2` is false and the call is
       never examined. The pathlib omission is deliberate rather than an oversight:
       those put the destination at args[0] with the SOURCE as the receiver,
       the mirror image of os.replace, so folding them in would flag every
       move OUT of an inbox as a delivery. Copy-family calls (shutil.copy,
       copy2, copyfile) are also out of scope; they deliver too, and closing
       that is a deliberate widening, not a bug fix.
