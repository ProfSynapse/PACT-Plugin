"""THE MARKER CLEAR, DRIVEN THROUGH A STATE ORACLE OVER THE MARKER FILE.

`track_files.clear_pin_staleness_marker_if_resolved` is what the shipped deny
text PROMISES a user: archive the stale pins and the gate clears inside the
same session. If it stops working, a user who OBEYS the refusal stays denied
on their own Pinned Context for the rest of the session. That is the cardinal
over-block.

WHY EVERY ARM HERE READS THE MARKER FILE AND NOT THE RETURN VALUE. Each exit
of that function returns None, and the body ends in a bare
`except Exception: return`. So an arm that calls it and asserts a quiet RESULT
passes when the function-local imports fail, when the session directory does
not resolve, and when the marker is not there. Three broken states and one
green arm. THE RETURN VALUE CARRIES NO INFORMATION, so the oracle is the
marker file and, where the marker cannot separate two states, a recorder on
the staleness signal.

THE SEAM, STATED BECAUSE PICKING THE OTHER ONE GIVES A GREEN ARM AND NO
SIGNAL. The function imports `check_pinned_block_signal` and `get_session_dir`
INSIDE its body, at call time. So the patch must land on the SOURCE modules,
`staleness` and `shared.pact_context`. There is no `track_files` attribute to
patch, and a patch aimed at one would not bind, would raise nothing the caller
sees, and would be swallowed by the bare except.

THE THREE CASES AND THE ONE MUTANT EACH ANSWERS TO. The three are separated on
purpose: each dies under a mutant that leaves the other two green, so no arm
here is riding another arm's decision.

  (a) the signal STILL reports stale pins, so the marker STAYS.
      Dies when the signal re-read is removed. THIS IS THE LOAD-BEARING ONE:
      removing the re-read is WORSE than removing the whole function, because
      it drops the marker while stale pins remain, which makes the trap vanish
      by deleting the evidence of it. Neutering the whole function does NOT
      redden this arm, because a function that does nothing also leaves the
      marker in place. So (a) is the only guard against that direction.
  (b) the signal has CLEARED on an archive Bash call, so the marker is REMOVED.
      Dies when the unlink is neutered, and dies when the whole function is
      neutered.
  (c) an unrelated Bash command touches nothing.
      Dies when the archive-token gate is removed.

CASE (c) CANNOT USE THE MARKER ALONE AS ITS ORACLE. "The marker is still
there" is also what a totally broken function produces, so that assertion on
its own is the quiet-return trap in a new place. (c) therefore records whether
the staleness signal was CONSULTED, and asserts the opposite answer for the
two commands under one fixture: an ordinary command must not reach the
re-read, and the archive command must reach it.
