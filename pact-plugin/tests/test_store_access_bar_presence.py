Cross-file copy fidelity for the store-access bar.

Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_store_access_bar_presence.py

WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, STATED AS THE JOB AND NOT AS THE RULE. The store-access
bar is ONE text that ships in many files. A rule held in many places drifts.
One editor corrects a sentence in the file they opened, the others keep the old
sentence, and no reader of any single file can tell. This keeps the copies IN
SYNC WITH EACH OTHER, for as long as they ship.

🔴 WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT MEAN, AND READ IT BEFORE YOU TRUST ONE.

  * IT DOES NOT TELL YOU THE SOURCE BLOCK IS CORRECT. It tells you the copies
    agree with the source. Somebody who edits the source and each copy together
    passes this file, and that is BY DESIGN: a deliberate reword must be able
    to land. The one-time check that the first placement matched the design was
    a separate act by a separate agent, and it is not repeatable from here.
  * IT DOES NOT CHECK THAT THE CAUSE IN THE PROSE IS TRUE. No test reads a
    natural-language cause for truth. If `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` leaves the
    connection function, or the context manager stops the close, the shipped
    cause goes stale and each arm here stays green.
  * IT DOES NOT COVER THE CALIBRATION SENTENCE. The same repair corrected an
    instruction in `agents/pact-secretary.md` about calibration statistics.
    That sentence ships with no arm in this file.
  * ITS WALK REACHES `pact-plugin/` AND NO FURTHER. A store-access surface
    written above that directory is outside each population here.

FOUR ARMS, AND EACH COVERS A FAILURE THE OTHERS MISS.

  1. FIDELITY. Each carrier holds one marked region, and each copy agrees with
     the source. A MISSING MARKER FAILS.
  2. EMPHASIS. A copy that agrees with the source apart from CAPITALISATION
     fails. The block shouts its bright line, and a quiet copy is a weaker rule
     that arm 1 passes in silence.
  3. POPULATION. Each instruction surface that reaches the store, and that
     takes no declared exemption, carries a marked region. This reaches a NEW
     teaching surface on the day it arrives.
  4. FACT. `setup_memory.py` holds no `--db-path` literal, and the source home
     names that file. The claim sits in one file and its evidence sits in
     another, which is the shape that earns a guard its place.

🔴 TWO POPULATIONS, AND ONE LIST CANNOT SERVE THE TWO.

  THE CARRIER POPULATION, for arms 1 and 2, is DERIVED FROM THE MARKER across
  ANY file type. A file that holds the begin marker is a carrier, whatever its
  extension and wherever it sits. A carrier added next month joins the
  comparison with no edit here, and no count in any document can go stale
  against it.

  THE INSTRUCTION-SURFACE POPULATION, for arm 3, is the five markdown patterns
  below. Arm 3 asks a different question: does a file hand a reader a route to
  the store with no rule attached. Widening THAT to Python would reach the
  memory package and each hook, which reach the store legitimately, and the
  result would be findings that are not defects.

🔴 AND A DECLARED FLOOR SITS BEHIND THE DERIVATION, BECAUSE DERIVATION ALONE
HAS A BLIND SPOT. Derivation notices a file that HAS a marker. Only the floor
notices a file that SHOULD have one and does not. A dropped marker removes a
file from the compared set in silence, and a smaller set that reports green
reads the same as a larger set that reports green.

MEASURED, AND IT IS WHY THE FLOOR CANNOT BE DROPPED IN FAVOUR OF AN ALPHABET:
of the three Python carriers, `archive_pin.py` names three route tokens and the
two memory-repair modules name NONE. So no widened alphabet reaches the two,
and a declared list is the only instrument that covers a member no alphabet can
speak to.

WHAT THIS GUARD HOLDS, AND WHAT IT MUST NOT.

  HOLDS: the two marker literals, which are the ADDRESS of the region. The
  declared carrier paths. The route tokens. The normalisation rule.

  DOES NOT HOLD: the block text. A copy of the guarded prose inside a test
  makes the TEST the specification, and it gives a prose maintainer one more
  place to edit, in the file they are least likely to open. Do not add the
  block here to make an arm stricter. ARM 2 OBEYS THIS TOO: it derives the
  emphasis from the source at run time rather than hold a sentence.

  THE BOUND ON THAT SENTENCE, because a reader applies a short rule more widely
  than it holds: THE MARKERS STAY. A marker is an address and not content. A
  test that drops the markers to obey the rule above cannot find the region it
  must compare.

WHY THE MARKERS FAIL CLOSED. Some context renderings strip an HTML comment, so
an agent that edits a carrier through such a rendering can drop a marker with
no intent to. A marker fault is a RED and not a skip.

CLASSIFY BY ROLE, NOT BY PRESENCE. THIS FILE HOLDS THE MARKER LITERALS, so a
marker-derived walk SELECTS IT. It is a GUARD and not a carrier, so it is named
out in `DERIVED_POPULATION_EXCLUSIONS` with its cause, and an arm below asserts
that the exclusion continues to do work. The design document sits above
`PLUGIN_DIR` and is outside each walk by a correct predicate, so it takes no
entry. A carve-out written for a non-member is the sign of a predicate aimed
wrong.

TO CHANGE ANY CONSTANT IN THIS FILE, STATE A CAUSE. Each module-level constant
sets what an arm requires, or which files an arm covers. A constant edited to
quiet a red turns this file into a MIRROR of the text it guards, and its green
then means nothing.

    # present and the SPELLING was new, which is the same miss this file has
    # recorded three times. These name the route as a caller writes it.
}

# 🔴 THE FORBIDDEN ROUTE, AND IT TAKES THE OPPOSITE RULE. These name the
# module API, which the store-access bar forbids. A file that teaches one of
# them teaches the route the rule removes.
#
# EACH TOKEN HERE IS EXPECTED TO BE IDLE. That is the whole difference from
# the set above. `ROUTE_TOKENS` name LEGITIMATE routes, so a token there that
# selects nothing is decay and an arm reports it. A token HERE that selects
# nothing means the tree is HEALTHY, and an arm that reddens on that is
# measuring the wrong thing.
#
# THE HISTORY THAT PRODUCED THE SPLIT, because a later reader will meet the
# same pressure. These three sat in `ROUTE_TOKENS`. A page taught the module
# API, the repair converted it to the CLI, and the tokens went idle one by
# one. The must-do-work arm reddened each time, and each red invited a token
# removal that would have left the guard blind to the NEXT page that teaches
# the forbidden route. ONE RULE OVER TWO KINDS OF TOKEN WAS THE DEFECT.
#
# THESE TOKENS DO SELECT FOR ARM 3. A file that names one reaches the store,
# so it needs the rule, and it needs it more than a file that uses the CLI.
# 🔴 STATED BOUND: THIS ALPHABET IS BOUND TO A BINDING NAME AND CANNOT SEE A
# REBIND. Each token below spells the receiver as `memory`. A reader who writes
# `m = PACTMemory()` and then `m.save(...)` reaches the store by the forbidden
# route and selects NOTHING here. MEASURED, and the instance is live outside
# this guard: a repository testing scenario binds `m` and calls `m.list(...)`.
#
# THE DANGEROUS DIRECTION IS THE REPAIR. An author who converts `memory.save(`
# to a different receiver satisfies this guard and keeps the forbidden route.
# So a green from arm 3 says "no token matched", and it does NOT say "no file
# reaches the store by the module API".
#
# DO NOT CLOSE THIS BY MORE SPELLINGS. A longer name list is the same defect
# with more rows, because the receiver is free. The repair is a predicate over
# the CALL rather than over the text. It is not on this branch, and the tracker
# carries it with the population widening, because either repair alone leaves
# the question open.

# a written count goes stale on the day a token or a pattern is added, and the
# stale form reads as a measurement.
# A WIDER ALPHABET REACHES MORE. An eighteen-token set reaches two further
