"""
Direct unit coverage for shared/agent_handoff_marker.py — the SSOT shared by
BOTH agent_handoff emit paths (agent_handoff_emitter "b1" + the lead-side
task_lifecycle_gate emit "b2"). #880 Fix B (#887 occupant-identity marker key).

This file is the HOME for module-level coverage of the SSOT primitives. It
focuses on the surface NOT already exercised through the emitter's main()
in the sibling files:

  - occupant_hash(): cross-process determinism (the hashlib-not-builtin-hash
    property #887 rests on), distinctness, path-safety, separator-collision
    resistance.
  - is_signal_task(): the shared emit-eligibility atom.
  - already_emitted(): the occupant-keyed test-and-set — specifically the
    #887 HEART (same team + same task_id + DIFFERENT occupant → BOTH emit)
    and the within-session ~37x re-fire dedup, with same-fixture positive
    controls.
  - the NEW post-mkdir TOCTOU containment re-check (realpath + commonpath
    after mkdir) — distinct from the is_symlink() PRE-check that the
    TestMarkerDirSymlinkGuard family in test_emitter_idempotency.py already
    covers. O_NOFOLLOW guards only the FINAL path component, so a symlinked
    marker_dir appearing in the race window would still let os.open write
    THROUGH it — the re-check is the only thing stopping the escaped write.

Already covered ELSEWHERE (not duplicated here):
  - sanitize_path_component() + degenerate-value guards → test_emitter_path_sanitization.py
  - is_symlink() PRE-check + fail-open (PermissionError/ENOSPC) → test_emitter_idempotency.py
  - 8-thread concurrent O_EXCL race → test_emitter_idempotency.py::TestConcurrentFireRace

Non-vacuity (#887): the same-task_id-different-occupant rows below FAIL if the
marker key is reverted to the bare {task_id} (pre-#887) shape — they are the
delete-the-fix counter-tests. See the docstring on TestOccupantKeyedDedup.

class TestTaskIdNormalisation:
    """_resolve_marker_target coerces task_id with str() BEFORE handing it to
    sanitize_path_component, whose bare re.sub RAISES TypeError on a non-str.

    WHY A RAISE IS THE SEVERE CASE, not a mis-key: marker callers sit inside
    emit paths that wrap their whole body in `except Exception: pass` (see
    task_lifecycle_gate's agent_handoff emit). The TypeError is therefore
    SWALLOWED — the emit is skipped and the event silently vanishes from the
    journal rather than failing loudly, so a consumer counting those events
    measures a population smaller than the one that occurred with no signal
    that anything was lost.

    NON-VACUITY — two INDEPENDENT mutations are needed, because no single one
    can red both properties:
      - delete the str() (revert to `sanitize_path_component(task_id)`)
        → every int row below ERRORS with TypeError.
      - collapse the coercion (e.g. `str(task_id)` → a constant)
        → the int rows stop raising and PASS, and only
          test_distinct_int_task_ids_still_discriminate reds.
    That second mutation is the point of the discrimination row: a
    normalisation that maps everything to one value ALSO removes the raise,
    so "no longer raises" alone cannot tell a fix from a lobotomy.

    NOT a restored capability — a NEW one. At base the int rows do not fail
    an assertion, they never REACH one: already_emitted(team, 83, occ) dies
    with TypeError before any comparison happens. So 83-vs-84 discrimination
    was not "working and preserved", it was UNREACHABLE. These rows establish
    that it is now reachable AND that it discriminates.

    SCOPE BOUND: task_id only, and the exclusions are not symmetric with it.
    occupant is a hex digest from occupant_hash() (str by construction).
    team_name is validated upstream against [A-Za-z0-9_-]+ and is NOT
    coerced — a non-str team_name raises AttributeError at .lower(), a
    DIFFERENT exception from a DIFFERENT line than the task_id TypeError this
    class is about. Do not read these rows as "all marker path components are
    normalised"; exactly one is. test_team_name_is_not_coerced pins the
    boundary so a later reader sees it was chosen rather than overlooked.

    The int arguments below are DELIBERATE contract violations, carrying
    type-checker suppressions at each site. task_id's annotation stays `str`
    on purpose: the coercion is a defensive backstop, not a widened contract.
    Passing a non-str task_id remains a CALL-SITE BUG — what changed is that
    the bug stops turning into a silent event loss.
