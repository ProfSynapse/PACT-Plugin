Presence pins for the import-bar cause in the memory-repair package.

Location: pact-plugin/tests/test_import_bar_cause_presence.py

WHAT THIS PROVES, AND IT IS NARROW ON PURPOSE. FOUR PROPERTIES, and the
heading below states what each one leaves open. Two are a PRESENCE, one is a
POPULATION RULE, and one is an ABSENCE.

  1. PRESENCE. Each module in the memory-repair package that states the import
     bar also carries the sentence that forbids an audit of which call is safe.
     That sentence is the only one that stops a reader who treats the bar as a
     DISTANCE to be measured rather than a rule to keep.
  2. PRESENCE. The package `__init__.py` carries the obligation that binds a
     later editor.
  3. POPULATION RULE. Each .py file in the package states the bar or takes a
     declared exemption, and each carrier known today stays in the derived
     population.
  4. ABSENCE. No file in the plugin tree carries one of the refuted spellings,
     apart from a declared exclusion.

WHAT A GREEN HERE DOES NOT MEAN. Read this before you trust it.

  * It does NOT check that the surrounding prose is true. No test can read a
    natural-language cause for truth.
  * It does NOT catch an incorrect cause in NEW WORDS. The refuted-spelling
    arms hold FIXED SPELLINGS, so they catch a revert, a bad merge, or an
    editor who restores a removed sentence from memory. A paraphrase passes.
    SOME ENTRIES SHIPPED AND SOME DID NOT, and the rule above
    `REFUTED_SPELLINGS` states the test that decides membership.
  * THE REFUTED-SPELLING ARMS REACH THE PLUGIN TREE AND NO FURTHER. They walk
    `PLUGIN_DIR`, so a refuted spelling written above that directory, at the
    repository root, is outside the scan.
  * A NEW FILE THAT SAYS NOTHING IS REACHED INSIDE THE PACKAGE, AND NOT
    OUTSIDE IT. The population rule fails on a new .py in the package that does
    not state the bar. The same file elsewhere in the tree is invisible here.

THE POPULATION HAS THREE PARTS, AND EACH COVERS A FAILURE THE OTHERS MISS.

  1. The DERIVATION reaches a carrier written later, on the day it arrives.
  2. `MINIMUM_CARRIERS` refuses SHRINKAGE for the carriers known today. It
     catches TWO conditions that no other arm catches: a carrier renamed out
     of the population AND declared exempt, and a carrier file deleted. A
     plain rename is NOT one of them, because part 3 catches that on its own.
  3. `EXEMPT_MODULES` extends part 2 to files nobody has written yet, which
     fixed paths cannot reach. AGAINST A RENAME, a module leaves the
     must-state-the-bar rule only by a declared line, and not by a rename that
     reads as tidying. A DELETION is a second exit, and part 2 covers it for
     the paths it holds.

EACH SET IN THIS FILE IS KEYED ON A RELATIVE PATH AND NOT ON A BASENAME. A
basename is not an identity: `__init__.py` occurs 9 times in the plugin tree,
so a basename key cannot separate a top-level file from one in a subdirectory,
and the most likely new file carries the most common basename.

An arm that asserts ONE member proves the set is not empty and proves nothing
about the rest. Non-emptiness and completeness are different properties.

THE FAILURE DIRECTION IS DELIBERATE. A legitimate reword trips these tests,
so they fail toward a FALSE ALARM and somebody must look. The pin to avoid is
the one that goes stale in silence. This is its opposite.

TO CHANGE ANY CONSTANT IN THIS FILE, STATE A CAUSE. The rule is stated over
the CLASS and not over a list of names, on purpose. Each module-level constant
here sets what the arms require, or which files the arms cover, so each one
weakens the guard if it changes for no reason. A list of names would go stale
the moment a constant is added, and a reader who trusts the list then learns a
rule narrower than the one that must hold.

If you update a constant to agree with new prose, or to quiet a red, and you
give no cause, this file becomes a MIRROR of the thing it guards, and its
green stops meaning anything.

MATCHING IGNORES WHITESPACE AND CASE, AND `carries` DOES THE TWO TOGETHER.
WHITESPACE: each guarded sentence wraps across lines in the file that carries
it, so a line-oriented search or a literal comparison cannot find it even when
it is present. Flatten first. CASE: this repository capitalises an
anti-permission rule for emphasis, so a strict comparison reddens on a
legitimate re-capitalisation. The reason for each sits above `carries`.

# its base is a figure without its counting rule. A key written against the
# wrong root matches nothing, so the file loses its place in the set and an arm
# reddens, which is the safe direction.
#
# THE FLOOR. Its unique coverage is TWO conditions, and `TestTheFloorEarnsIts
# Place` below asserts each one by emptying this set and reading the result.
#   1. A carrier renamed out of the population AND declared exempt. The
#      exempt arm then passes, because the path is declared, and only this
#      floor holds.
#   2. A carrier file deleted. It leaves the disk and the population together,
#      so the exempt arm sees nothing missing.
# A PLAIN RENAME IS NOT UNIQUE TO THIS FLOOR. The exempt arm catches that on
# its own, measured with this set emptied.
#
# To remove a path from this floor, state a cause, as for the two sentence
# constants above. A path removed to quiet a red turns the floor into a report
# of the current population, which is the same mirror failure.

# MODULES THAT DO NOT HAVE TO STATE THE BAR. Keys are relative to
# `PACKAGE_DIR`, as stated above `MINIMUM_CARRIERS`. Empty today, and that is
# the point: each .py file in this package must state the bar, or appear here.
#
# AN ENTRY HERE LIFTS ONE RULE AND NOT THE OTHER, AND THIS FILE USES THE WORD
# POPULATION FOR TWO SETS. An entry removes the file from the MUST-STATE-THE-BAR
# rule above. It does NOT remove the file from the DERIVED POPULATION, which is
# the set of files that DO state the bar and which
# `modules_missing_the_cause_clause` reads. So an exempt file that states the
# bar is under the cause-clause rule as before.
#
# The floor above protects the carriers known when it was written. It cannot
# protect a carrier written later, because its paths are fixed. This closes
# that gap from the other side, AGAINST A RENAME: a file leaves the
# must-state-the-bar rule by an entry here, which is a visible line in a diff,
# rather than by a rename of the subject phrase, which reads as tidying and is
# what defeated the derivation. DELETION IS A SECOND EXIT AND IT TAKES NO ENTRY.
# `MINIMUM_CARRIERS` covers a deletion for the paths it holds. A carrier added
# later and then deleted is covered by nothing here.
#
# To add a path here, state a cause. A path added to quiet a red is the mirror
# failure again. A KNOWN CARRIER CANNOT ESCAPE THIS WAY, AND THE REASON IS NOT
# THAT AN EXEMPTION ALONE GOES RED. An exemption alone changes nothing, because
# the file continues to state the bar and stays in the derived population. The
# escape asks for an exemption AND a rename together, and `MINIMUM_CARRIERS`
# reads the derived population, so it goes red on that pair.

#
# WHETHER THE SPELLING SHIPPED IS NOT THE TEST, and a reader who applies that
# rule will remove a correct member. Two entries here were drafted and removed
# BEFORE release. A criterion that excludes a member the set holds is not the

#
# PART 1 IS THE ONE THAT REFUSES AN ENTRY MOST OFTEN, and it refuses on a

        # with a live control. The remaining four verbs are UNMEASURED, because
        # their control is inert, so they are not clear and they are not
        # refuted. A sentence about the whole flag is therefore incorrect for
        # one part of the surface and unsupported for the rest.

        # THE REFUTED CONTENT IS THE WORD "only", which turns a description into
        # a PERMISSION. That is the same reasoning this file applies to the word
        # "before" in the entry above, so the entry is narrow for the same cause.
        # A wider entry such as "is for test isolation" would ban a TRUE future
        # sentence about the test-harness variable.
        #
        # MEASURED before it was added, across 519 .py and .md files in the
        # plugin tree: this spelling and two wider candidates each return 0
        # hits, so the entry bans no sentence that is present. A control string
        # that IS present returned 3 hits in the same walk, so the zero is a
        # measured absence and not an empty read. This is PREVENTIVE, and the
        # warning above against an entry added to quiet a red does not apply,
        # because nothing is red.

        # column, so no tool change closes the gap and the DEMAND had to go.
        #
        # WHY THIS SPELLING AND NOT A WIDER ONE. `per-domain breakdown` is

        # ONE ENTRY COVERS THE REVERT. The two impossible demands, the mean and
        # the per-domain breakdown, shipped in ONE sentence, so a revert
        # restores the two together and this entry catches it. A second entry
        # would help only against a partial restore, and it would grow the list

# loses its exclusion and reddens, which is the safe direction.
#
# WHY PER SPELLING RATHER THAN PER FILE. A document that QUOTES one refuted

# on the other four claims as well.
#
# THIS IS AN ENUMERATION, so it takes the same state-a-cause discipline as the

        `modules_missing_the_cause_clause` derives from `modules_stating_the_bar`
        and reads no exemption at all. So a module that takes a line in
        `EXEMPT_MODULES` and states the bar anyway is under the cause-clause
        rule as before.

        THE EXEMPTION MUST DO WORK HERE, or this arm agrees with a mechanism
        that is broken. `silent.py` carries that weight: the population
        predicate reports it without the exemption and reports nothing with it.
        `helpers.py` then shows the cause arm reaches an EXEMPT module. The
        last pair is the control: it puts the clause into the same file and
        reads the predicate again, so the red above comes from the absent
        clause and not from the construction.

        WHY `EXEMPT_MODULES` IS PATCHED, AND THE ARM IS BLIND WITHOUT IT. The
        shipped set is EMPTY. An edit that teaches the cause arm to read that
        set changes nothing observable while it stays empty, so a local
        exemption alone cannot catch the edit that makes the message above
        true. This puts the same two paths into the shipped constant, so such
        an edit drops `helpers.py` and this arm fails.

        RESIDUAL, AND IT IS THE BOUND OF THE WHOLE ARM. This pins the
        BEHAVIOUR. It does not catch an edit to the arm message above that says
