PACT Memory Lazy Initialization Module

Location: pact-plugin/skills/pact-memory/scripts/memory_init.py

Summary: Provides lazy initialization for the PACT memory system. Instead of
running at session start (which penalizes non-memory users), initialization
happens on first actual memory operation.

Handles:
1. Auto-installing dependencies (pysqlite3, sqlite-vec, model2vec)
2. Migrating embeddings when dimension changes (e.g., backend switch)
3. Catch-up embedding for memories that failed embedding at save time

Used by:
- memory_api.py: Calls ensure_memory_ready() before database operations
- Can be called directly for explicit initialization

Thread-safety: Uses threading.Lock for the session-scoped initialization flag.
