PACT Memory Configuration

Location: pact-plugin/skills/pact-memory/scripts/config.py

Centralized configuration for the PACT Memory skill.
All path resolution is defined here to ensure consistency across all modules.

Used by:
- database.py: Database path resolution (resolve_db_path, store_scope)
- setup_memory.py: Directory creation (get_memory_dir)
- cli.py, memory_api.py: Store binding for one call (store_scope)

ONE EXPRESSION COMPOSES THE STORE FILE PATH, and it is inside `resolve_db_path`
below. Each other name delegates to it. The tree used to hold THREE derivations
that could disagree inside one invocation: this module composed the name, so did
`database.get_db_path`, and `database.get_connection` had a third rule,
`db_path or get_db_path()`, which made the caller path a RIVAL of the resolver
rather than an input to it. Two of the three are gone. To keep several
derivations in step is the defect's own generator, so the repair removes them.

EVERY PATH HERE RESOLVES AT USE TIME, NEVER AT IMPORT TIME. This module used to
export `PACT_MEMORY_DIR` and `DB_PATH` as module-level constants, each computed
from `Path.home()` when the module first imported. That made the store location
a property of WHEN the module was imported rather than of the environment, and
it produced two defects a caller could not see:

  1. A test that redirects `Path.home()` protected the store only when this
     module happened to import INSIDE that test. Import it at collection time --
     which any module-level `from scripts.memory_api import ...` does -- and the
     constant was already bound to the real home, so the redirect reached
     nothing. The protection existed and was ACCIDENTAL, decided by import order.
  2. `from .config import DB_PATH` COPIED the value into a second module's
     namespace, so patching it here did not reach that module at all.

Resolving in a function removes both: no stored value can go stale, and no
second copy can diverge. The environment variable exists because no in-process
mechanism crosses a process boundary -- a spawned child is a fresh interpreter,
in which a patched `Path.home()` never happened.

# Environment variable that relocates the store THIS MODULE resolves.
#
# ITS EXTENT IS NARROWER THAN THE STORE ROOT, and the gap is not obvious from
# here. It governs `get_memory_dir()` and everything derived from it, which is
# the database. It does NOT govern `hooks/track_files.py`: that writes
# `session-tracking/` INSIDE the same root, but resolves it through
# `get_claude_config_dir()`, so that subtree follows `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and is
# unaffected by this variable. Setting only this one relocates the database and
# leaves the tracking data where it was.
#
# DELIBERATELY MEMORY-SPECIFIC. It names this store and nothing else. A general
# home or config override is the wrong shape here: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` takes
# precedence over `Path.home()` in `get_claude_config_dir`, so honouring that
# variable would shadow the home-redirect convention the rest of the suite is
# built on. Narrow scope is what makes this variable safe to add.
#
# AN EXPLICIT DISCRIMINATOR BEATS AN INFERRED ONE, and that is the load-bearing
# reason for this design rather than the relocation feature it also provides.
# Isolating a test process from the real store looks like it needs the code to
# work out whether it is under test, and every mechanism for working that out
# can be WRONG ABOUT THE WORLD: `_refuse_live_db_under_pytest` in cli.py keys on
# an inherited `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`, and its own docstring records that the
# variable is absent during collection and around session-scoped setup, and that
# its fail direction is ALLOW.
#
# The two are complements, not alternatives: this harness sets the variable in
# `pytest_configure`, which runs BEFORE collection -- the window that guard's
# own docstring declares it does not cover.
#
# This variable removes the inference entirely. A test harness SETS it and a
# production process does not, so there is nothing to detect: the resolver
# cannot be mistaken about whether a variable was set.
#
# The guarantee is narrower than it looks, and the narrow one is what to rely
# on. The resolver cannot be mistaken about whether the variable was SET, but
# nothing here detects a SET value that points at the real store. The safety
# comes from the harness, which assigns unconditionally and never with
# `setdefault`.
#
# Keep this a REDIRECT, never a refusal: production is pathless by design, so a
# resolver that refuses the real store breaks every production caller.

# that file is routinely not called `memory.db`. Bind a DIRECTORY instead and
# the resolver composes <dir>/memory.db while the connection opens the caller
# file, which is the disagreement this whole design removes.
#
# ⚠️ THREAD HAZARD, LATENT AND NOT LIVE. This package starts no thread today.
# `database.get_connection` passes `check_same_thread=False` to `sqlite3.connect`,
# which DECLARES that a connection may cross a thread. A ContextVar set in one
# thread is NOT readable in a thread started after it, because a new thread
# begins with an empty context. Add a worker thread and this binding goes
# silently absent there, and the store reverts to the default with nothing to
# see. The remedy at that time is to pass the resolved path across the thread
# boundary explicitly. Do not rely on this variable for it.

    A REDIRECT, NEVER A REFUSAL. An unbound resolution falls through to the

    isolation this scope provides: `archive_pin --index N` is a documented
    production command that passes no path on purpose.

    ⚠️ A `db_path` of None INHERITS the enclosing scope. IT MUST NOT RESET TO
    THE DEFAULT, and the obvious spelling does exactly that. An unconditional
    `_STORE_DB_PATH.set(db_path)` writes None, which IS the default, so an inner
    pathless call would CLEAR an outer binding for the length of its block. That
    is not a theoretical case: it is the main path. A scoped caller reaches the
    search layer, which opens `db_connection()` with no argument, and the inner
    reset would send that read back to the default store. The failure is silent
    against a test that sets no outer scope, because there a reset from None to
    None changes nothing observable. Only a NESTED arm separates the two
