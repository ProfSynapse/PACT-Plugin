# Run the test suite against a DECLARED tree, and record which tree was measured.
#
# WHAT THIS SOLVES
#   A suite run reports a count. The count is correct for the tree the run
#   measured, and the capture file does not say which tree that was. So a run
#   in a different checkout produces a clean summary that certifies nothing
#   about the branch under review, and it reads the same as a faithful run.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES
#   1. REFUSES before pytest starts if the run would measure a tree other than
#      the declared one.
#   2. STAMPS the tree identity into the capture file above the pytest output,
#      so a later reader can tell what was measured without a re-run.
#
#   The STAMP is the load-bearing part. The REFUSAL is the enhancement. If the
#   two are ever in tension, keep the stamp.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT COVER
#   This wrapper gates the MERGE-GATE suite run only. It requires a git
#   worktree, because tree identity is what it asserts. An exported or copied
#   tree has no identity to assert, so this wrapper REFUSES it and tells the
#   operator to call pytest directly. That refusal is loud and immediate, and
#   the operator routes around it in seconds.
